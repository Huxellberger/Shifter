# Shifter
Hack Manchester 2015 Project, Visual Novel Car Dating Sim In Python With Ren'py Engine.

## Creators 

The project was created by Jake Huxell and Samuel Hodgkinson Of The University Of Manchester in order to try and win many hacking based goodies. The Project Aims were:

- To create an entertaining spoof on visual novels involving rental cars and sms updates.

- Further our understanding of Python Programming.

- Have a whale of a time.

After managing to stay awake for the full 24 hours, I can say it was worth it! Well, depending on your taste for walls of text and poorly implemented sound effects. 

We used the Ren'py engine as it would be very difficult to create an engine from scratch for our project considering the tight time limit, as well as have anything to show for. We did modify the engine however, mainly adding Clockwork API integration so that in-game characters can berate you.

## Terms And Conditions

You are free to download and play this game as you see fit, but do be mindful that it was created by two mental fellows in roughly a day. It's rather rough around the edges. You may not take any code written by Jake Huxell or Samuel Hodgkinson and claim it as your own. The assets are dirty modifications of google image results and only placeholders, thus we do not recommend toying with them in your own commercial endeavors.

*You do not have permission to host this project on your own site. This project may only be hosted in this repository and nowhere else.*
