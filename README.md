# Shifter
Hack Manchester 2015 Project, Visual Novel Car Dating Sim In Python With Ren'py Engine.

## Creators 

The Project Aims were:

- To create an entertaining spoof on visual novels involving rental cars and sms updates.

- Further our understanding of Python Programming.

- Have a whale of a time.

After managing to stay awake for the full 24 hours, I can say it was worth it! Well, depending on your taste for walls of text and poorly implemented sound effects. 

We used the Ren'py engine as it would be very difficult to create an engine from scratch for our project considering the tight time limit, as well as have anything to show for. We did modify the engine however, mainly adding Clockwork API integration so that in-game characters can berate you.
